Octopress Bitcoin Donation Aside
================================

This is a new custom aside for [Octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress?ref=commandbarr) that shows a button for [Flattr](http://www.flattr.com) in your sidebar.

To install copy the files included to your octopress installation.

Obviously change the User Id to your own, or keep mine. I don't mind. ;)

Then change the line:

`default_asides: [`

Add to it:

`custom/asides/flattr.html`
